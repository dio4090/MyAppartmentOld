    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    AF:59:1A:C7:25:AE:88:28:D6:E8:FF:6B:39:07:44:CF:DF:41:58:83

    AF:59:1A:C7:25:AE:88:28:D6:E8:FF:6B:39:07:44:CF:DF:41:58:83

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
